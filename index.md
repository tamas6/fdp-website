      <strong>FairOS</strong><br>FairOS is aiming to become a decentralized operating
      system that manages the resources of the computers in its network, like storage
      and compute. The nodes that run FairOS will be part of the global network that
      will run applications which can make use of the storage and compute that is available.
      It consists of two layers, namely FairOS-dfs (storage) and FairOS-compute (compute).
